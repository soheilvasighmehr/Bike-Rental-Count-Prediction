# Bike Rental Count Prediction - January 2021
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting bike-sharing demand using machine learning techniques, based on a dataset containing 10,886 records with 12 features, including variables like temperature, humidity, windspeed, season, and various time-based attributes. The initial exploration involved loading the dataset, checking its structure, and summarizing key statistics, such as distributions across seasons, weather conditions, and holidays. The analysis included visualizations of temperature, windspeed, and rental count distributions to uncover patterns. A correlation heatmap helped identify relationships between features, offering insights into which variables might be most predictive of rental demand. Notably, no missing values were found, simplifying the data preparation.

For the prediction phase, multiple models were developed and compared. Starting with Simple Linear Regression (SLR) on features like temperature, the model's performance was improved through Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which incorporated a broader set of features like humidity, windspeed, and time attributes (hour, month, year). Polynomial Regression was later employed to capture non-linear relationships, which significantly enhanced the model's accuracy. The evaluation metrics, such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE), revealed that Polynomial Regression delivered the best performance, with improved fit and error reduction. The final model was applied to a test dataset to predict rental counts, and negative predictions were corrected before saving the results in a CSV file. The project demonstrates a full cycle of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model selection, and evaluation for a real-world prediction problem.
